# Evaluation Rubric

## How We'll Evaluate Your Submission

### Core Functionality (40%)
- **Contact Management**: Can we create, view, update, and delete contacts?
- **Message Generation**: Does Ollama integration work properly?
- **History Tracking**: Can we see previous messages?
- **User Experience**: Is it usable without reading the code?

### Code Quality (30%)
- **Organization**: Clear file structure and separation of concerns
- **Readability**: Clean, self-documenting code with comments where needed
- **Best Practices**: Proper error handling, input validation, security basics
- **Consistency**: Consistent naming, formatting, and patterns

### Architecture & Design (20%)
- **Scalability**: Could this grow to handle more features?
- **Database Design**: Sensible schema and relationships
- **API Design**: RESTful, logical endpoints
- **Technology Choices**: Appropriate tools for the task

### Documentation (10%)
- **Setup Instructions**: Can we run it following your README?
- **Architecture Overview**: Do we understand your design decisions?
- **Assumptions**: Are trade-offs and limitations documented?

## What We're NOT Looking For
- Perfect code (we know you have limited time)
- Over-engineering (keep it simple)
- Fancy UI (functional is fine)
- 100% test coverage (a few key tests are enough)

## Tips for Success
1. **Get it working first**, then refactor if time permits
2. **Document your assumptions** when requirements are unclear
3. **Focus on core features** before attempting bonus features
4. **Make it easy to run** - we should be able to start with one command
5. **Show your thinking** - comments and documentation help us understand your approach

## Red Flags to Avoid
- ❌ Doesn't run with docker-compose
- ❌ No documentation
- ❌ Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- ❌ No error handling
- ❌ Overly complex for the requirements
